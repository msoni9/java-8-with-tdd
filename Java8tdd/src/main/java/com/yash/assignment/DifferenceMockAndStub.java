 * --------------Difference between Mocks and Stubs-------------------
 * Tests written with 
 * MOCKS usually follow an initialize -> set expectations -> exercise -> verify pattern to testing. 
 * While the pre-written STUB would follow an initialize -> exercise -> verify.
 * 
 * ----------------Similarity between Mocks and Stubs-----------------
 * The purpose of both is to eliminate testing all the dependencies of a class or
 * function so your tests are more focused and simpler in what they are trying to prove.
